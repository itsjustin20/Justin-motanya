## EXERCISES SUMMARY

### **EXERCISE 1: NUMPY ARRAYS (BANKING SECTOR)**
- Uses a 2D NumPy array to represent transaction volumes for 4 branches over 6 months.
- Calculates total transactions per branch.
- Identifies the branch with the highest transactions.
- Computes the average monthly transaction volume.
- Reshapes the array into a 3√ó8 format and explains the implications.

### **EXERCISE 2: PYTHON LISTS (LOGISTICS SECTOR)**
- Demonstrates how lists are used to manage delivery routes.
- Adds and removes routes dynamically.
- Sorts and reverses the list alphabetically.
- Counts routes starting with a specific letter.
- Uses list comprehension to filter routes longer than 10 characters.

### **EXERCISE 3: PYTHON TUPLES (HEALTHCARE SECTOR)**
- Stores patient information as immutable records using tuples.
- Accesses specific values (age, heart rate).
- Shows why tuples are ideal for immutable data.
- Converts between tuples and lists for updates.
- Extracts all patient names from a tuple of records.

### **EXERCISE 4: PYTHON DICTIONARIES (E-COMMERCE SECTOR)**
- Uses dictionaries to manage a product inventory system.
- Adds, updates, and deletes inventory items.
- Implements a function to find products with low stock.
- Displays all products and their quantities.
